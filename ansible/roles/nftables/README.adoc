Install nftables based firewall

Set up /etc/ooni/nftables/

Rules for specific services are *not* configured by this role

When creating rules to accept TCP traffic from any IPv4/6 address,
files are named with the port number to detect collisions.

Example (also see roles/nftables/tasks/main.yml):

/etc/ooni/nftables/tcp/8080.nft

```
add rule inet filter input tcp dport 8080 counter accept comment "MyService"
```


Otherwise:

/etc/ooni/nftables/tcp/5432_postgres_internal.nft

```
add rule inet filter input ip saddr { 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16 } tcp dport 5432 counter accept comment "Internal PostgreSQL"
```
